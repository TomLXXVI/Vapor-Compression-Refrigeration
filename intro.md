# Vapor Compression Refrigeration with Python

This Jupyter book is about **modeling and simulating a (single-stage) vapor compression machine with the Python programming language**. In the first chapter some basic theory is offered about the standard vapor compression cycle. Subsequent chapters give step-wise demonstrations on how a single-stage vapor compression machine, that is operating at steady-state, can be analyzed using a few classes from my own package `hvac`, that can be found in my [GitHub repository](https://github.com/TomLXXVI/HVAC).
