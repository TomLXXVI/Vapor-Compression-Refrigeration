    "The `Fluid` class, contained inside the package `hvac.fluids`, provides a thin wrapper around the third-party library **[CoolProp](http://www.coolprop.org/)**, which gives you access to thermodynamic properties of many fluids. The list of available fluids can be found in CoolProp's documentation. The `Fluid` class has also been developed to allow direct use of physical quantities. The use of physical quantities is based on another third-party package **[Pint](https://pint.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)**. To use physical quantities in a notebook or script we need to import the `Quantity` class from the main package `hvac`."
