# Vapor Compression Refrigeration with Python

This book is about modeling and simulating a single-stage vapor compression machine with the Python programming language. In the first chapter some basic theory is presented about the standard vapor compression cycle. Subsequent chapters give step-wise demonstrations on how a single-stage vapor compression machine at steady-state operation can be analyzed using some classes from my own package `hvac`, that can be found in my GitHub repository.
